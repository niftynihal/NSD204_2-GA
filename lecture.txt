CI/CD

Continuos Integration/Continuos Deployment

Continuos Integration - refers to the process of automatically building and testing code changes whenever they are made;


Continuos Deployment - refers to the process of automatically deploying code changes to the production servers without we having to redeploy the entire applicaiton again


CI/CD Pipeline - basically a list of processes/tools that are in place to ensure CI and CD;


Github is the commonly used tool for storing and integrating code -->it provides -->  Github Actions 


Github Actions -   it's a CI/CD tool that is present in the Github platform;
                   It helps developers to automate their software development workflows by defining custom actions
                These custom actions can be triggered by different events - commit, push, pull request etc;


                For example : we can define a action like - when code is pushed, run this particular command "npm run eslint"

1. Automating software development workflows;

        dev --> pushes code 

        action --> whenever code is pushed, run test cases;

        test cases are run and if no error --> only then code gets deployed;

2. build, test, deploy code or trigger notifications;

3. Automating repetitive tasks;



Let's start implementing


1. Create an empty github repository
